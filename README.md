My goal is to learn and help to learn java by doing projects!

1- Java Crash course with MOSH: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eIrMbAQSU34&t=10s
   Fundamentals :

        //Java Types (Variables and Constants, Primitive and reference Types, 
                      Casting, Numbers, Strings and Arrays, Read input);

2- Mini Porject "Calculator" with Mosh

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3- java_Date: this project contains many useful examples of "Date" objects in Java, and how to use them:
to print, to format, to introduce by user (Scanner), as attribut in classes ans so on.
